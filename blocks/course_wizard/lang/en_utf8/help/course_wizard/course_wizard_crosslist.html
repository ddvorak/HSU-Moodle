      <h2>Course Wizard Crosslist</h2>

      <p>If you have multiple course sections but would like to access them as
          one course and provide one set of materials and assignments you can
          choose to crosslist your courses. Crosslisting will create one parent
      section to easily manage multiple sections of the same course. </p>
      
      <p>This can be especially useful for FIGS (Freshmen Interest Groups)
          or TRIGS (Transfer Interest Groups) which have different section numbers in Peoplesoft
      but meet at the same time and place as another course section.</p>
