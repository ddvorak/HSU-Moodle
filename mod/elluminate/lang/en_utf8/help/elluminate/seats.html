<p align="center"><b>Reserved seats</b></p>

<p>This option allows you to reserve a set number of seats for your
    session.</p>

<p>If you reserve seats for your session, it means that you will
   always have that number of spaces available for people to join
   in.  Another meeting scheduled during the same time period can
   not take away any of your reserved seats.</p>
